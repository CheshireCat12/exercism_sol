Hello, good solution.

Just 2 little things:

- In python if you want to access to the last element of a list you can do it directly like that : `scores[-1]`.
- you can use the `max()` function to directly return the personal best value.

Hello, good solution :)

Indeed there is a cleaner way to solve the personal_top_three() function. You can sort the scores and take the highest values ;)
(Another small thing, I thing it's better to use `scores[-1]` to access to the last element in the `latest()` function. Like that you don't remove this value of your list)
