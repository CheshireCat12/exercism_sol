==========================
Hello, good solution. :)

Just 2 little things:

- You are using a default value for the variable name, that's a good idea. Why not directly give "you" as default value. Like that you don't need to use a conditional statement ;)

- I don't know if you know but you can give a default value to the argument of a function. And if you give "you" as a default value you don't need after that to use `*names` or a conditional statement.

- In Python3, You can use the f-string to format a string more easily ([f-string examples](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/))

Hello, very good solution :)

You used a default argument for the function parameter and you used f-strings to format your string. That's perfect ;)




I approve your solution, I let you free to do the little modifications that I propose :)
